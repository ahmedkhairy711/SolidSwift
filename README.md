SOLID in Swift is a project dedicated to showcasing how to implement the SOLID principles using Swift. SOLID is a set of design principles aimed at making software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. This repository demonstrates each principle with practical, well-structured Swift code, promoting clean architecture and strong coding practices.

SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that lead to better code:

    1.    S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility.
    2.    O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    3.    L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
    4.    I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. This encourages smaller, more specific interfaces.
    5.    D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
