SOLID in Swift is a repo dedicated to showcasing how to implement the SOLID principles using Swift.

 SOLID is a set of design principles aimed at making software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.


SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that lead to better code:

    S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    
    O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
    
    L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    
    I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    
    D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
